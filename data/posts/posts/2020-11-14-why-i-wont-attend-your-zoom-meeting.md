i wrote this as a quick explainer for members of the reed college
community to explain why zoom is bad and we should use different
software. i've posted it publicly in hopes that other people will find
it useful in convincing their boss, professor, teacher, community,
government, etc. to find a better alternative.

## zoom is *harmful* software produced by a malicious and incompetent company:

* zoom
  [lied](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/zoom-lied-to-users-about-end-to-end-encryption-for-years-ftc-says/)
  to users, claiming their software had strong privacy guarantees than
  it does, for years. only when coming under massive scrutiny due to
  increased usage during the pandemic has zoom changed its tune and
  built real privacy protections into their software. it should be
  noted that even after aceding to public pressure to do so that zoom
  [dragged](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/06/amid-pressure-zoom-will-end-to-end-encrypt-all-calls-free-or-paid/)
  its feet on making data privacy available to all users.

* zoom

  with human right violators to
  [suppress](https://theintercept.com/2020/11/14/zoom-censorship-leila-khaled-palestine)
  dissent from human rights groups, both in and outside the
  violators' borders.
  
* zoom has a

  and [storied](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x56.html)
  [history](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/07/zoom_vulnerabil.html)
  of bad security vulnerabilities in their software. i can only guess,
  but i'd imagine security comes second to features and performance
  for zoom.
  
* zoom is [non-libre/free](gnu.org) software. among other problems,
  this means that the people who use this software cannot easily
  assess how it works: what information it sends to zoom the company
  or to any other party; what information it collects; what commands
  it runs on their computer; etc.
  
* zoom effectively forces users to install their software on their
  computer. while zoom does have a web client, it is gated behind a
  super annoying captcha, even when logged in to a user account. i
  suspect the motive for this is to drive up the "total number of
  installations" metric to boost market value-relevant install-base
  metrics.

## there are alternatives:

* [jisti](jitsimeet.org) is a libre/free alternative to zoom developed
  in the open. jisti has offered end-to-end encryption longer than
  zoom. jitsi has roughly the same performance as zoom for reasonably
  sized meetings (up to ~50 attendees.) jitsi is *more convenient*
  than zoom: jitsi's web-client doesn't nag you to install desktop
  software on your computer through unnecessary captchas. you can
  operate jitsi on your own server with no need to trust a third-party
  deployment of its source code. that said, there is a free hosted
  solution called JitsiMeet.

* [webex](https://www.webex.com/) is a proprietary alternative to
  zoom. i'm told that it scales better than jitsi, offering comparable
  performance to zoom for very large meetings, but otherwise i don't
  know much about it. i can't really recommend it because of the
  licensing and closed development model.
