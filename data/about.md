## quick facts
**who**: jay kruer.

**what** (i am doing): _an undergraduate thesis_: 
    - topic for wonks: _studying the use of category-theoretic gluing for metatheory of lambda calculi_
    - topic for well-adjusted people: _using fancy math to better understand how programming languages work_

**why**: gluing allows for a more conceptual take on the famed technique of
_logical relations_ in proofs of metatheoretic results. not just that, this
technique scales more directly to complicated problems than the more ad-hoc
techniques used in the past.

**when**: now through december 2021.

**where**: reed college, portland, oregon
