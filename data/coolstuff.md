hope to use this as a way to remember where to find good content on
the web.

## books i like
- [combinatorics by peter j. cameron](https://www.amazon.com/Combinatorics-Techniques-Algorithms-Peter-Cameron/dp/0521457610)

straight to the point, no nonsense book; a great reference for quick
reading, but also not so terse as to be unsuitable for
first-encounters. i liked this way more than the
[one](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Elementary-Beyond-Undergraduate/dp/0387955852)
i was assigned in my undergrad intro course. i recently learned of a
[new book](http://people.reed.edu/~davidp/113/resources/113full_text.pdf)
out of my department which looks neat. i'll be checking out the
section on Catalan structures pretty soon.
